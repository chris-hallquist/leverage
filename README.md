This is a set of small programs I wrote because I'm an amateur finance buff and was trying to get a better grasp of the use of leverage in finance. Leverage.java is a pure random simulation, and the first command line argument is the number of trials. Historical.java is based on real data from CSV files, and currently can only be configured by editing the code by hand and recompiling it. leverage.py exists mainly because I was curious about benchmarking Python against Java. The "Kelly" in kelly_simulator.py is the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), a criterion for determining the amount of risk taking (bet-sizing or leverage) that will maximize long-term wealth growth while minimizing your chances of going broke.
